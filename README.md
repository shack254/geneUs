## Description

geneUs provides user with the opportunity to analyse his/her genetic information if the user has their own dna sequence available. The application determines the frequency of a mutated codon that could lead to the occurence of a genetic disorder. 
The website also provides vital information on some of the common genetic disoders anin order to help our users understand how to optimize and manage such disorders.

## Behavior driven development (BDD)
 Behavior our program handles  | Input Example | Output Example |
 | ----------------------------- | ------------- | -------------  |
 | User is able to input a sequence | The user copy/pastes the sequence into the text area | A confirmation message pops up|
 | User is able to test for certain disorders |User clicks on a "Test Result" button | They receive an alert on the frequency |
 | User is able to get more information on a genetic disorder | The user clicks on the "More Info" button | More information on the disorder shows up |
